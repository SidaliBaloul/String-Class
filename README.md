# String-Class
This Is A C++ String Class That Contains String Functions

This Project Was Implemented as part of cours 10 in ProgrammingAdvices [www.programmingadvices.com]

the idea is to reuse all the string related functions we built earlier in previous courses, we collected them inside a separate header file(clsstring.h)
and wrapped them in a class to apply Object-Oriented Programming (oop)
